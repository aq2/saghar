            <h2>What is Ayurvedic Yoga Massage?</h2>
            <div class="left">
              <p>
                Ayurvedic Yoga Massage has its origins in India and is an
                ancient healing system that uses an effective combination of
                powerful deep tissue massage with coordinated breath work and
                yoga stretches.
              </p>
              <p>
                The Ayurvedic system stimulates, opens and balances the flow of
                energy throughout the body, assisting in our own natural
                tendency towards self-healing.
              </p>
              <p>Benefits include:</p>
              <ul>
                <li>stress relief</li>
                <li>elimination of toxins</li>
                <li>stimulation of blood circulation</li>
                <li>
                  muscular/skeletal realignment leading to improved posture,
                  digestion, and increased flexibility
                </li>
              </ul>

                A massage with Saghar is a very special experience. She has an
                extraordinary talent for 'reading' the body and what it needs,
                and her massage is truly healing on both a physical and a
                psychological level.

                  I am Saghar (Nasrien) Amozgar, Persian in origin. I came to
                  the UK in 2000 after 8 years of study in India, completing my
                  PhD in Psychology and my journey of discovery into yoga,
                  meditation, and traditional ayurvedic massage.
                </p>
                <p>
                  I studied Ayurvedic Yoga Massage under the expert guidance of
                  Swami Varidi, who trained with the renowned Kusum Modak
                  herself. I qualified in Pune 1999. I continued to work closely
                  with Swami Varidi, organising his courses in Europe and
                  assisting him with their delivery in the UK.
                </p>
                <p>
                  I was fortunate to study in Pune City in the neighbourhood of
                  the Iyengar ashram. My learning and understanding of yoga
                  continued with my qualification from the Sivananda yoga center
                  in Kerala, India in 2004. Since then I have been teaching many
                  classes including Muslim women community centres, children and
                  open classes for all.
                </p>
                <p>
                  I established the Ayurvedic Yoga Association in 2004. My
                  passion is sharing my experiences and insights gained over the
                  years of body-work, not only through my therapeutic work with
                  individuals, but also by running regular workshops and
                  professional standard training courses for practitioners to
                  spread this wonderful ancient technique around the globe.

                Ayurvedic Yoga Massage is a deep-tissue massage which takes
                place on a floor mattress. It involves deep strokes and a series
                of yoga stretches to help to eliminate toxins and to rejuvenate
                the body.
              </p>
              <p>
                In Ayurvedic Yoga Massage we use both the feet and the hands.
              </p>
              <p>
                One of the best things is using calamus powder which helps to
                stimulate, and is good for blood circulation.

                when acupuncture or physiotherapy were not helping my situation,
                I asked Saghar to have a series of focused massages to heal.
                After two massages only, my foot and my elbow, after six months
                of pain, were immediately better, and I realized that Saghar can
                deliver the real core of Ayurveda practice in a majestic way!
                Deep gratitude.

              <p>
                I can teach you the important elements of Ayurvedic Yoga
                Massage, either in the form of an introductory one-day workshop
                as seen below, or two types of training course, explained on the
                right.
              </p>
              <p>
                Further down the page you will find details of my Sivananda Yoga

              <h4>AYM Workshops</h4>
              <p>
                I run regular one day workshops designed to introduce you to the
                essential basic skills of Ayurvedic yoga massage. You will learn
                how to give a back, neck and shoulder massage to your friends
                and family.
              </p>
              <p>
                The workshops cater for complete beginners, or for further
                enhancing your existing skills if you are already a therapist.
              </p>
              <p>
                Prices are &pound;40 for individuals, &pound;60 for a couple

              <h4>Training Courses</h4>
              <p>
                AYM diplomas are divided into two separate levels, each taking a
                total of 24 hours to complete. The courses combine both
                practical techniques and theory-based learning. Courses can be
                either intensive - four days of seven-hour sessions (including
                one hour lunch-break); or non-intensive - divided into four
                eight-hour sessions over two months.
              </p>
              <p>
                Fully-detailed illustrated manuals will be provided to each
                student along with the course. The successful applicant will be
                awarded a Ayurvedic Yoga Massage certificate, according to the
                level of the course.
              </p>
              <p>
                It is important to have attended a workshop session before
                taking the training course. Alternatively, you can have a short
                interview with Saghar either by phoning her on 07974 470 610 or

                <p>
                  Sivananda Yoga is a classical and holistic approach to Hatha
                  Yoga that stretches and tones the whole body.
                </p>
                <p>
                  This style of yoga has not been modified or watered down. The
                  teachings have survived intact and are practiced as originally
                  presented in India by Swami Sivananda in 1936. Sivananda Yoga
                  is an international practice which follows the same format
                  worldwide.
                </p>
                <p>
                  Sivananda Yoga is a complete healing system designed to help
                  the body maintain a natural healthy state. It was developed by
                  Vishnu-Devananda who wrote one of the contemporary Yoga
                  classics, <i>The Complete Illustrated Book of Yoga</i>, first
                  published in 1960 and still one of the best introductions to
                  yoga available.
                </p>
              </div>
              <div class="right50">
                <p>
                  Sivananda training involves frequent relaxation and emphasizes
                  full, yogic breathing.

                <p>Five principles of yoga - by Swami Vishnu-Devananda</p>

                  <li>Proper Exercise – Asanas (steady poses)</li>
                  <li>Proper Breathing – Pranayama (prana, or vital energy)</li>
                  <li>
                    Proper Relaxation – Savasana (pose for maximum relaxation)
