expresses a deeply felt, lived and underlying vision of yoga as a way of life. She 
is known for her down-to-earth, skilled and authentic approach.</p><p>Poornam attended her first yoga class in the west of Ireland, and recalls walking 
home that evening knowing she had bunped into something that would inform the way 
that she would live for the rest of her life. She took the jump and relocated to 
London to study at the celebrated Satyananda Yoga Centre.</p><p>She travelled to India in 1993 to the Bihar School of Yoga and commited her life to 
the practices and path of yoga. Upon returning to the UK, she founded the 
PadmaSambhava Yoga Centre in Wales, whilst integrating yogic principles into her 
everyday life. She taught a wide range of yoga and meditation methods for 15 years, 
returning to the Bihar School in India most winters to further her study amongst a 
broad circle of international teachers and experts.</p></div><div class="right50"><img src="../images/retreat/poornam.jpg"></div><h4>Ayurvedic yoga massage workshop</h4><div class="left50"><p>Not only will you receive a therapeutic deep tissue massage, but you will also
