    <h1>Introduction to Joyful Living
      <br>An Online Training Programme by Saghar Amozgar
      <br>Starts 5th September 2022
    </h1>
    <div id="content">
      <h2>Adopt ten practices and enjoy a better quality life</h2>
      <p>Joyful Living provides step-by-step instructions to catalyse more energy,
        improve digestion, cultivate peace of mind, by evolving your habits towards
        life-long health and wellness.
      </p>
      <p>What is your biggest personal challenge at the moment?</p>
      <p>Are you:</p>
      <ul>
        <li>burned out and tired?</li>
        <li>overwhelmed?</li>
        <li>stressed?</li>
        <li>always running out of time?</li>
        <li>lacking ambition and joy in life?</li>
        <li>struggling with weight problems?</li>
        <li>suffering from indigestion?</li>
        <li>unable to sleep soundly?</li>
        <li>suffering from auto-immune disease?</li>
        <li>having relationship difficulties?</li>
        <li>depressed?</li>
        <li>addicted?</li>
      </ul>
      <p>Would you like to experience better sleep, upbeat and relaxed emotions,
        and less stress?</p>
      <p>Would you like to know how to prepare quick and healthy meals, leading to smooth
        digestion and easy elimination?</p>
      <p>Would you like to feel calmer, and have more time to enjoy the good things in life?
      </p>
      <h2>A Solution - Adopt daily habits to promote your mental clarity, overall ease, and to
        enjoy a deeper connection to life.
      </h2>
      <p>Knowing what we <i>should</i> do is not the same as knowing <i>how</i> to do it day-in,
        day-out. After many years practising Ayurvedic yoga massage and teaching yoga, I have
        noticed that most people need more than merely getting service - I felt the lack of
        continuity and support for their personal growth.
      </p>
      <p>The Joyful Living Programme is online, or hopefully face-to-face in the future, and
        is a journey that will certainly enhance your well-being and uplift your life's
        quality.
      </p>
      <p>I will coach you to adopt new habits, supporting a dynamic group of enthusiastic and
        motivated people like you to aim for higher consciousness.

        <blockquote>Saghar's knowledge, intuition and ability to support me in building a
          collection of new joyful habits has been a wonderful experience. Having joined
          Saghar's Joyful Living course for a year, I can highly recommend her for her
          ability to take you on a journey to the heart of joyful living, challenges included.
          'Patient', 'kind' and 'inspirational' are only a few words to describe her. Fantastic
          course...just make the leap...tools for life!</blockquote>
